# Spotify-Screen
This project was designed to only fit the programmer's screen(3840 x 2160 | Landscape) since as of 10/22/2023, the programmer does not know how to implement responsiveness into the page but will learn how to when they expand their knowledge.
This project has/had no intention of copying every function/style of the actual Spotify app. This project was to be familiar with how to implement styles and learn CSS flex.
This project was last handled on 10/22/2023
